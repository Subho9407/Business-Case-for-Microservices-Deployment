## Business Case for Microservices Deployment (DevOps-CICD) 🚀

This repository contains the business case and implementation plan for deploying a microservices-based application using .NET, with each microservice having its own SQL Server database. The deployment targets include Azure App Services and virtual machines (VMs) hosted on Windows and Linux, leveraging containerization and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

### Objectives 🎯

- **Ensure 100% Availability**: Utilize deployment strategies such as Blue-Green Deployment and Canary Releases to guarantee no downtime. 🕒
- **Enable Auto-Scaling**: Implement auto-scaling rules and mechanisms to scale based on demand. 📈
- **Cross-Platform Deployment**: Support both Windows and Linux environments for a versatile deployment approach. 🖥️🐧
- **Efficient Deployment Management**: Use YAML for configuration and Terraform for infrastructure provisioning. 📜⚙️

### Architecture Overview 🏗️

1. **Microservices**:
   - Four microservices implemented in .NET.
   - Each microservice has its own SQL Server database. 💾

2. **Deployment Targets**:
   - Azure App Services for some microservices. ☁️
   - Virtual Machines (two Windows and two Linux) for others. 💻
   - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for containerization. 📦

### Implementation Plan 🛠️

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform**:
   - Define Terraform scripts for creating Azure App Services, AKS clusters, VMs, and networking components. 📝

2. **Containerization**:
   - Create Dockerfiles for each microservice. 🐳
   - Build and push Docker images to Azure Container Registry (ACR). 📤

3. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy microservices to AKS using Kubernetes manifests. 🕹️
   - Deploy microservices to Azure App Services. ☁️

4. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**:
   - Use GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps to automate build, test, and deployment processes. 🔄
   - Implement Blue-Green Deployment and Canary Releases for zero-downtime updates. 🟦🟩🐦

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Configure Azure Monitor and Application Insights for performance and health tracking. 📊
   - Set up centralized logging with Azure Log Analytics. 📋

This business case demonstrates a comprehensive approach to deploying a resilient, scalable, and efficiently managed microservices-based application using modern DevOps practices. 🌟
